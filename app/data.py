        "name":"Baked Eggplant Parmesan",
        "ingredients": {["2 medium eggplants, sliced into 1/2-inch thick rounds","1 1/2 cups Panko breadcrumbs","1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning, homemade or store-bought","2 eggs (or 1 egg + 2 egg whites)","1 (25 ounce) jar DeLallo Tomato Basil Pomodoro Fresco Tomato Sauce","2 cups grated Mozzarella cheese (I used part-skim)","2/3 cup finely-grated Parmesan cheese","1/2 cup loosely-packed chopped or julienned fresh basil","salt","cooking spray (or olive oil in a Misto)"]},
        "instructions": {"step1":"If you have extra time and would like to remove some of the bitterness of the eggplant, sprinkle each round with a pinch of salt.  Then place the rounds in a colander in the sink to drain, or place them on a few paper towels for about 30 minutes.  Rinse the salt off with water, then proceed with the recipe.","step2":"Preheat oven to 425°F.  Prepare two baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside.","step3":"In a shallow bowl, whisk together Panko breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon salt until combined.  In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth.  Dip an eggplant round on both sides in the whisked egg mixture, then immediately dip it in the breadcrumb mixture until the eggplant is completely coated, then set on a parchment-covered baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant rounds until they are all evenly spaced on the baking sheets.  Bake for 20 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until the breadcrumbs are toasted and slightly golden.  Remove from the oven and set aside.","step4":"Spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of an 11 x 8-inch baking dish.  Place half of the eggplant in a (mostly) even layer along the bottom of the baking dish.  Spread an additional 1 cup of tomato sauce evenly over the eggplant.  Then sprinkle 1 cup Mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, followed by 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, followed by 1/4 cup of the fresh basil.  Repeat with another layer of the remaining eggplant, then tomato sauce, then Mozzarella, then Parmesan cheese.","step5":"Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and starts to turn slightly golden around the edges, and the sauce is bubbly.  Remove and sprinkle with the remaining basil.  Serve immediately."},

        "name":"Gluten-Free Chicken Parmesan",
        "ingredients": {["3 tablespoons olive oil plus more for greasing","3 tablespoons your preferred gluten-free flour mix","Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper","1 egg","2 teaspoons gluten-free Dijon mustard","2/3 cup gluten-free panko breadcrumbs","6 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese divided","2 boneless skinless chicken cutlets","11/2 cups (12 ounces) your preferred jarred gluten-free marinara sauce","2/3 cup about 2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese","1/2 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves"]},
        "instructions": {"step1":"Heat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a large, ovenproof frying pan or 9 by 13-inch baking dish.","step2":"In a small bowl, combine the flour, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper.","step3":"In another small bowl, whisk together the egg, mustard, and 2 teaspoons water.","step4":"In a third small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, 4 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, and a few grinds of pepper.","step5":"One at a time, place each chicken cutlet between two pieces of plastic wrap and, using a mallet or the bottom of a frying pan, gently pound to an even 1⁄4-inch thickness.","step6":"Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour. Shake off the excess, then dunk the chicken into the egg mixture to coat. Finally, coat with the breadcrumb mixture, using your hands to pack the crumb mixture onto the chicken pieces. Reserve on a plate.","step7":"Line a plate with paper towels. Heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the chicken in one layer, in batches, if necessary. Cook until each side is golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked chicken to the prepared plate and sprinkle with salt.","step8":"Spread half the marinara sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer the chicken on top of the sauce. Pour the remaining sauce over the chicken, top with the mozzarella cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and bake until the cheese is golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.","step9":"Chop the fresh basil leaves, sprinkle them over the chicken Parmesan, and serve."},
